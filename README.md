In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The Sudoku file contains code in python for a Sudoku solver. In order to complie that you would need to download pygames module and python3 and then type in terminal:

### `python3 GUI.py`

The main project I done in c++ is a text editor and given that it's school work I don't want to upload it here.

I also include the HTML&CSS project I been working on recently, still have to fix some issues with that.
